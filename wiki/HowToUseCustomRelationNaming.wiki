#summary read how you can handle custom relation nameing

= Introduction =

The plugin supports a singualrize and pluralize functionality to implement one-to-many relations in a handy way. The underlying algorithm for this is based on english grammar and in most cases it works properly. But sometimes it doesn't - for this kind of "bug" we implemented a special markup for table comments.

= Details =

Let's assume we have a table "user" and we want to call it for singular "customer" and for plural "customers". Add the following markup as a comment in the table "user":

foreignAliasOne is used, when the user is represented as a single user object
{{{
{doctrine:foreignAliasOne}
customer
{/doctrine:foreignAliasOne}
}}}

foreignAliasMany is used, when the user represents a collection of user objects
{{{
{doctrine:foreignAliasMany}
customers
{/doctrine:foreignAliasMany
}}}

and here is an additional fallback solution if you want to use the same for singular and plural, e.g. "staff" but this saves only some chars and real world examples are rare ;)
{{{
{doctrine:foreignAlias}
staff
{/doctrine:foreignAlias}
}}}

Keep in mind, that this is optional - you can of course rely on the built in transformation algorithm.

If you use this feature, keep also in mind, that we use some kind of hierarchy in chosing the right alias. In the first place we check for foreignAliasOne and foreignAliasMany, afterwards for foreignAlias and at least for built in transformation.
