#summary How to bypass options in table comments

= Introduction =

You possibly noticed our approach to add behaviours to the models with a very simple hack. Over the past few weeks we also implemented a few other things which makes your life easier using the plugin.

= Details =

== How to use ==
To bypass options to your yaml scheme, you have to select a table in your Workbench model and add some special formatted comments to the comment field.

See this example, which enables the timestampable behaviour:
{{{
{doctrine:actAs}
  actAs:
    Timestampable:
{/doctrine:actAs}
}}}

*Be aware of the 2 leading spaces in front of the actAs. These indentions are mandatory.*

== Available options ==
|| *option* || *effect* || *intention* ||
|| actAs || bypasses yaml directly under the table name || add behaviours or other options to your table model ||
|| entityName || the table name will be exactly this name || prevent the plugin from do any special treatment to the table name ||
|| localAlias || none? ||  ||
|| foreignAlias || see foreignAliasMany and foreignAliasOne || fallback solution for foreignAliasMany and foreignAliasOne ||
|| foreignAliasOne || name of the table when referenced in a relation (representation of *one entity*) ||  ||
|| foreignAliasMany || name of the table when referenced in a relation (representation of a *collection of entities*) ||  ||
|| mnRelations ||  ||  ||
|| externalRelations || bypass a relation || helps you to integrate relations to tables that are not related to your scheme, like integrating external plugins ||

=== Example 1: actAs ===

*be aware of the 2 leading spaces*
{{{
{doctrine:actAs}
  actAs:
    Timestampable:
{/doctrine:actAs}
}}}

=== Example 2: entityName ===
{{{
{doctrine:entityName}
Status
{/doctrine:entityName}
}}}

=== Example 3: localAlias ===
{{{
{doctrine:localAlias}
???
{/doctrine:localAlias}
}}}

=== Example 8: externalRelations ===

*be aware of the 4 leading spaces*
{{{
{doctrine:externalRelations}
    Users:
      class: sfGuardUser
      local: project_id
      foreign: user_id
      refClass: UserProject
{/doctrine:externalRelations}
}}}
