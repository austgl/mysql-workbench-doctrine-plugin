#summary Read this entry to learn how you can prevent the plugin from renaming your tables

= Introduction =

As you may noticed, the plugin changes table names by simple algorithms. This works quite ok for english table names and if you respect a few naming conventions.

In some cases you don't want this behaviour e.g. when you use non english table names or table names with special naming conventions.

= Details =

To disable table renaming you just have to:

  # open the plugin code
  # find the config section
  # change the option "preventTableRenaming" to true
  # (optional) change the "preventTableRenamingPrefix" to your preferred, otherwise relations start with "col_" which stands for collection
