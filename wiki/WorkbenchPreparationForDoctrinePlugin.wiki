= How to prepare workbench before using doctrine plugin =

Please read the following section carefully, because this may be important for you.

== Proposals on table naming conventions ==

  # use *uppercase table names* (e.g. Persons not persons)
  # use *plural table names*, because they consist of sets of entities and not just one entity (e.g Persons not Person)
  # *be aware* of critical table names like "Doctrine" or "Table"

== Plural table names result in singular ORM classes ==

The plugin has a build-in functionality to singularize table names. This means even you declare a table Persons in Workbench this will result in a PHP class Person.

== Change the default settings in workbench ==

Please select in the workbench menu *Tools -> Preferences* and choose the section *Model* in the tab menu. Change the default settings as shown in the table below.

|| *field* || *from* || *to* ||
||PK name||{{{id%table%}}}||{{{id}}}||
||Associative table name||{{{%stable%_has_%dtable%}}}||{{{%stable%%dtable%}}}||
